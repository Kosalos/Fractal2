# Fractal2
Ray Marching Fractals for Windows

Ported parts of my OSX_BareBonesRayMarching project to Windows.\
I used VS2019 Community edition.\
Compute shader draws to a texture that is displayed on a textured quad.\

Update:\
Added OrbitTrap coloring, which adds a lot of neat effects.

Note:\
No, your machine isn't broken. The HLSL compile takes 8 minutes!\
If you are adding your own Frags I suggest you comment out as much of\
fractal.hlsl as possible to speed things up as you develop it.
