Ray Marching Fractals for Windows

Ported parts of my OSX_BareBonesRayMarching project to Windows.\
I used VS2019 Community edition.\
Compute shader draws to a texture that is displayed on a textured quad.\
Getting HLSL working, and learning how things are done on Windows took a little while,\
but the results so far are great!\
I think the fractals render much faster on Windows + HLSL vs. Apple + Metal.\
Anyhow, this program is good start..

Note:  This is my first Github project from a Windows environment.\
If I screwed it up somehow, please let me know.
